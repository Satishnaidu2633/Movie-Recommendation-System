# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a **Movie Recommendation System** using **cosine similarity** to suggest movies based on user preferences.

## 📌 Features
- Recommends movies similar to a given movie.
- Uses **cosine similarity** to measure the relationship between movies.
- Efficient implementation for fast recommendations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Programming Language)
- **Pandas** (Data Handling)
- **NumPy** (Numerical Computation)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning)
- **Cosine Similarity** (Recommendation Algorithm)

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
git clone https://github.com/Satishnaidu2633/Movie-Recommendation-System.git
   ```
   
## 🔮 Future Enhancements

We plan to enhance the **Movie Recommendation System** by adding advanced techniques and improving scalability.

### 🔹 1. Improve Recommendation Accuracy  
✅ **Current**: Uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** for content-based filtering.  
🔲 **Enhancement**: Implement **word embeddings (Word2Vec, FastText, or BERT)** for better similarity detection.

### 🔹 2. Implement Collaborative Filtering 🤝  
✅ **Current**: Uses **content-based filtering (TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity)**.  
🔲 **Enhancement**: Introduce **collaborative filtering** (user-based and item-based) using **Matrix Factorization (SVD, ALS)**.

### 🔹 3. Build a Hybrid Recommendation System 🏆  
🔲 **Enhancement**: Combine **content-based filtering** with **collaborative filtering** to make recommendations more **personalized**.

### 🔹 4. Deploy as a Web Application 🌍  
✅ **Current**: Runs in a Jupyter Notebook.  
🔲 **Enhancement**: Deploy using **Flask / Streamlit** with an interactive UI where users can input a movie name and get recommendations.

### 🔹 5. Integrate with TMDb API for Real-Time Data 🎬  
✅ **Current**: Uses a **static movie dataset**.  
🔲 **Enhancement**: Fetch **real-time movie data** (genres, cast, ratings) using **TMDb API** to provide **up-to-date recommendations**.

### 🔹 6. Support for User Ratings & Preferences ⭐  
✅ **Current**: Recommends based on movie metadata only.  
🔲 **Enhancement**: Allow users to **rate movies**, and refine recommendations based on **user preferences**.

### 🔹 7. Optimize for Large Datasets 🚀  
✅ **Current**: Uses **pairwise cosine similarity**, which is **computationally expensive** for large datasets.  
🔲 **Enhancement**: Use **Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN)** or **Faiss Indexing** to improve scalability.

### 🔹 8. Add a Recommendation Explanation Feature 📊  
🔲 **Enhancement**: Implement an **explainability** module that shows **why a movie is recommended** (e.g., **similar actors, genre, keywords**).
